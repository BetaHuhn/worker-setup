Interactive setup and deployment of pre-made CloudFlare Workers

</div>

## üëã Introduction

While `wrangler generate` is meant to generate a completely new worker from an existing template, `worker-setup` is meant to setup a pre-made Worker like [cf-worker-redirect](https://github.com/BetaHuhn/cf-worker-redirect).

The basic wrangler configuration, required KV Namespaces and Environment variables are stored in the `workerConfig.toml` file. When a user wants to setup your Worker, they can simply run `worker-setup start` and they will be guided through the process of setting up and deploying the Worker. Required KV Namespaces are automatically created and the user is asked to input all required Environment variables.

## üöÄ Get started

Install [worker-setup](https://github.com/BetaHuhn/worker-setup) via npm:

```shell
npm install worker-setup
```

Start the setup process:

```shell
worker-setup start
```

> Requires a local workerConfig.toml file

## üìö Usage

```
worker-setup setup
```

Will start the interactive setup process. Required KV Namespaces are automatically created and the user is asked to input all required Environment variables. The final `wrangler.toml` will be generated from the template.

---

```
worker-setup generate
```

Will use a local `workerConfig.toml` and environment variables/.env file to generate a `wrangler.toml`

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

1) Create a `wranglerConfig.toml` file, fill it with the options you would normally put into `wrangler.toml`

2) Add `wrangler.toml` to your `.gitignore` file

3) Specify the bindings for required KV Namespaces:

```toml
kv_namespaces = [ "KV_NAMESPACE_EXAMPLE" ]
```

4) Specify required Environment Variables/Secrets:

```toml
environment_variables= [ "SECRET_EXAMPLE" ]
```

## Example intructions for your README

Ensure you have [`wrangler`](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler) installed and configured.

Clone this repo and cd into it:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/betahuhn/cf-worker-redirect && cd cf-worker-redirect
```

Next start the interactive setup process:

```shell
worker-setup start
```

You will be asked to input a few values specific to your CloudFlare Account and the programm will guide through the process of deploying the Worker.

## üíª Development

- run `yarn lint` or `npm run lint` to run eslint.
- run `npm link` to setup the program for development.
- run `yarn build` or `npm run build` to produce a compiled version in the `dist` folder.
